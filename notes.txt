1. No dropping rows for dealing with null values - Your MCAR, MAR and MNAR tasks will come to your rescue 
2. Clean your notebook and proceed with app development 
3. Perform corrections if they seem necessary 
4. Phase-1 of development: Just add the necessary deliverables. Do optimization later. Try remove junky code if possible 
5. Phase-2 of development: Organize your code AND remove unwanted junk 
6. Phase-3 of development: Optimize your code AND steer ahead - Remove all "inplace" code, actually - they don't work for me 
 
Problem Statement 
- What exactly do I have to cluster? 
Ans. Cluster attack locations ON the basis of kills AND stuff
